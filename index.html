        /* 
        This is a game of Rock Paper Scissors.
        For now, the game is played entirely in the console so there is no user interface. 

        Rock Paper Scissors has 2 players. In real life, each player randomly chooses between
        rock, paper, or scissors. Rock represents players' hands in a fist. Paper represents
        players' fingers fully extended so their hand looks flat like paper. Scissors are 
        represented by only players' index and middle finger extended, as to look like scissors. 
        Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock 
        (or paper covers rock as often said). 

        In this game, rock, paper, and scissors are represented by the words rock, paper,
        and scissors. The 2 players are a human and the computer. Once this is defined, 
        the player makes their choice using a prompt(). The computer makes a choice randomly.
        Once the winner is determined, a message is displayed telling the player who won 
        the game. If both the computer and player make the same choice, the game is tied. 
        If the player does not input a valid choice, a message displayd telling the player 
        to input rock, paper, or scissors. This is a single round. The console also keeps score. 
        The game is played for 5 rounds.
